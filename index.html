<h1>SoundClout Application User Guide</h1>
<br>
<p>The Soundclout app is an application intended to control and distribute a series of instructions to raspberry pi devices for use in a sound art installation. Even though the intended use of the app is for an art installation, it can still serve as a generalized raspberry pi controller.</p>
<p>The raspberry pis need to be configured with specific code we have developed in order to properly recieve and execute instructions from the soundclout app. A guide for setting up the RPi devices can be found <a href="https://github.com/SCCapstone/SoundClout/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-MotorSlider-circuit-diagram">here</a></p>
